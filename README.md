# CricketSeamDeliveryAnalysis
Pitchwolf
Analyzed dataset of 100+ cricket deliveries to predict ball speed and identify key influencing features
Implemented 12 regression models and attained the best result of 96% correlation through Gradient-Boosting
Identified Seam Angle to be the most important feature affecting ball speed, with 35% importance.
Performed optimization using NumPy for an optimal ball speed 5% faster than standard conditions.
